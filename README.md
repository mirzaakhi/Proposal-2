## Abstract

People often call a doctor, whenever they have suffered from cold and cough or fever or any other diseases. But, when they become mentally weak, they don't spontaneously consult a psychiatrist, despite being their cumbersome mental situation. Especially, in this post-COVID 19 era, the challenging economic condition may affect the mental health of the people quite alarmingly. People are going to be prone to develop a wide range of psychological stress, that includes the symptoms like abrupt mood-swing, insomnia, anxiety, emotional exhaustion, depression, post-traumatic stress, etc. Also, unemployment, lower GDP, inflation, etc. can make this situation worse, that too on a massive scale. Thus, in this project, we are going to focus on the mental well-being of the people, by studying their daily habits which can be constructed, based upon various data from different IoT devices.
